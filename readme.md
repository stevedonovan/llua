llua is a higher-level C API for Lua, organized around reference objects.
It was inspired by [luar](http://github.com/stevedonovan/luar) and
[LuaJava](https://github.com/jasonsantos/luajavaâ€Ž) which
provide similar operations when using Lua with Go and Java. The idea
is to encapsulate a Lua reference as an object which supports general
operations such as indexing (setting and getting), size, pushing on
the Lua stack and calling.

For instance, a common use of Lua is to load configuration files:

```lua
-- config.lua
alpha = 1
beta = 2
gammon = 'pork'

```

Here is how this file can be loaded into a custom environment:

```C
    llua_t *env = llua_newtable(L);
    err_t err = llua_evalfile(L,"config.lua","",env);
    if (err) {
        fprintf(stderr,"could not load config.lua: %s\n",err);
    } else {
        av = llua_gets(env,"gammon");
        printf("gammon was %s\n",av);
    }
    --> gammon was pork

```

This example also works with both Lua 5.1 and 5.2, by hiding the
difference in how 'environments' work with the API.
